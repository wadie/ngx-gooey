<h1 align="center">The gooey effect for Angular</h1> 
</p>
The 'gooey effect' has been made popular by various (amazing) blogposts over the years. This tiny component makes it easy to use within Angular, and has improved the implementation. It's optimized to be as sharp/crisp as possible, since existing implementations can be a bit blurry. Safari support (which can be notorious, and is usually missing) has been added as well.

## Installation

```sh
npm install ngx-gooey
```

## Usage

You can either import into your NgModule:

```js
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

// Import the library
import { Gooey } from 'ngx-gooey';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    Gooey, // <-- Add this line
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Or directly into a standalone component:

```js
  standalone: true,
  imports: [Gooey],
```

Then use it in your template:

```html
<ngx-gooey> â€¦ </ngx-gooey>
```

You can put regular HTML elements inside `ngx-gooey`, but using an SVG is recommended for better browser support. Shape blobbing will be applied to everything within the component.
